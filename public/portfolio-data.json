Instead of a conventional demonstration, I developed a game-inspired adventure, where two characters embark on a journey facing exaggerated, comical challenges that represent real-world sealing issues. Drawing inspiration from classic games, I designed a battle system reminiscent of Final Fantasy VII to integrate the product’s unique selling points (USPs). Every encounter—both characters and enemies—symbolizes the obstacles of proper sealing in a playful and engaging way. I was responsible for character design, scriptwriting, and storyboarding the entire project before collaborating with an animator, who brought everything to life. This was one of my first large-scale animated projects, blending storytelling, humor, and technical product showcasing into a fresh and dynamic experience.",

To achieve the look of a seamless one-take, we mounted a RED Komodo camera directly onto the lead actor’s head - an exciting yet challenging process that required close collaboration. Since the actor essentially became the cinematographer, we worked together to ensure every moment was captured effectively. Choreographing movement through space, managing lighting shifts, and coordinating a large cast added to the complexity, but ultimately, we created a visually engaging and immersive commercial.

Our goal was to showcase the dynamic lifestyle within the development and the rich history of the area. We employed aerial videography to capture the impressive architecture and the Peninsula’s integration into London’s skyline. The video featured interviews and testimonials, adopting a documentary-style format inspired by popular streaming platforms, to authentically convey the project’s vision and appeal. This project was particularly exciting as it allowed us to delve into the transformation of a significant London area, highlighting contributions from renowned architects and planners.

Suddenly, the night turns around, and they end up having the time of their lives, proving that Lanique can quite literally save the day. As someone with a strong comedy background, I loved working on this. The challenge was to create humor in a short time, relying on physical comedy and expressive reactions.

Two stranded bikers in the middle of nowhere, trying everything to hitch a ride - only to fail spectacularly. But the moment they crack open a LosBros drink, a stunning girl stops instantly. Just when they think their luck has turned, she swipes their drinks and drives off, leaving them in shock. The whole project was designed to be run-and-gun, embracing playful physical comedy, exaggerated expressions, and dynamic zooms—inspired by directors like Edgar Wright. With no dialogue, the humor relied purely on performance and visual storytelling. Coming from a comedy background, I loved working with the actress to fine-tune every reaction and beat. A light, energetic shoot with a sharp comedic twist - exactly what makes LosBros impossible to resist.",

We utilized a specialized macro probe lens, the Laowa 24mm f/14 2X Macro Probe, known for its unique ability to capture close-up shots with a wide-angle perspective. This allowed us to achieve dynamic movements and intricate details, bringing the energy drink to life on screen. To enhance the visual impact, we experimented with lighting techniques to simulate a stormy atmosphere, incorporating rain effects to evoke the brand’s energetic essence. I also took on the editing process, ensuring the final video conveyed the intended intensity and excitement. It was a fulfilling day in the studio, resulting in a commercial that I’m truly proud of.",

It follows newlyweds William and Jane Chase, whose perfect suburban life unravels when a cryptic crossword in the local paper begins to expose dark truths about their town — and their marriage. As secrets rise to the surface, Jane must decide how far she’s willing to go for the truth.\nA film about power, appearance, and rebellion, _The Newspaper_ is a love letter to mid-century aesthetics and the strength of voices long kept quiet.\nStay tuneed for a teaser trailer releasing soon.\n",
