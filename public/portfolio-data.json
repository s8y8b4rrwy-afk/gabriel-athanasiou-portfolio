      "description": "A project I created for WakeUp, WakeCup is a simple yet peaceful concept featuring their water bottle/thermos. The idea was to capture the feeling of a crisp autumn hike in the UK – someone enjoying a quiet moment in nature with their drink in hand. Serene, atmospheric, and effortless, the project was all about embracing the small joys of being outdoors. A fun and refreshing shoot that kept things minimal yet meaningful.",
